# Family
The coding challenges are set in the planet of Lengaburu. King Aurther is the emperor and has been ruling for the last 350 years (they have long lives in Lengaburu you see)

In this problem we have to write code to model out the  family tree so that when given a ‘name’ and a ‘relationship’ as an input, the output are the people that correspond to the relationship.

Input needs to be read from a text file, and output should be printed to console.
